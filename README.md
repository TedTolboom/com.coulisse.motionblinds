### DISCOVER MOTIONBLINDS
Motionblinds is a ground-breaking window covering automation solution that makes motorized blinds available to everyone. The blinds are super easy to install and can be operated from anywhere, in any way. Discover the endless options to find the solution that fits your requirements.

### SMART WINDOW COVERINGS
Smart window coverings automatically adapt to your daily rhythm and to natural elements, such as temperature and daylight. Even when you are away from home. This makes your smart home safer, more comfortable and more energy efficient. Discover the endless possibilities of Motionblinds.

### USAGE
To connect your Motionblinds devices to Homey, you must have a Motionblinds Wi-Fi bridge in your home network that can control up to 30 different blinds. The bridge is configured with the blinds you need by using the official Motionblinds app. Homey communicates with one or more of these bridges to control the devices connected to them. You can also link the blinds to a remote. Note that remotes are a useful addition to Motionblinds devices but cannot be added directly to the bridge or Homey. The remote controls the blind directly, and the blind reports what is happening back to the bridge and Homey. 

In order for Homey to be allowed to send commands to the bridge, it needs a key. The key can be configured in the Homey Motionblinds app settings. You will find instructions there on how to obtain the key.

### EVE MOTIONBLINDS
The new Eve Motionblinds product line is also supported by this app, provided you connect them using the Motionblinds Wi-Fi bridge as there is currently no support for Matter in Homey.
