USAGE

To connect your Motionblinds devices to Homey, you must have a Motionblinds Wi-Fi bridge in your home network that can control up to 30 different blinds. The bridge is configured with the blinds you need by using the official Motionblinds app. Homey communicates with one or more of these bridges to control the devices connected to them. You can also link the blinds to a remote. Note that remotes are a useful addition to Motionblinds devices but cannot be added directly to the bridge or Homey. The remote controls the blind directly, and the blind reports what is happening back to the bridge and Homey. 

In order for Homey to be allowed to send commands to the bridge, it needs a key. The key can be configured in the Homey Motionblinds app settings. You will find instructions there on how to obtain the key.

EVE MOTIONBLINDS

The new Eve Motionblinds product line is also supported by this app, provided you connect them using the Motionblinds Wi-Fi bridge as there is currently no support for Matter in Homey.

AVAILABILITY

Motionblinds products are developed by Coulisse and can be found in window coverings from various other manufacturers across the world.

You can also find Motionblinds controls in products from Zonnelux, BSL raambekleding, Smartblinds.nl, Kwantum, Hornbach and many others. You can find a store near you at the Motionblinds website.
